# ConsoleReader

ConsoleReader is a C++ project created for my studies. It provides a fully console-based interface that allows users to log in, navigate menus, browse poems, search for titles, and manage favorites. The application retrieves poem data from the external [PoetryDB API](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb) and communicates with it using the [restclient-cpp](https://github.com/mrtazz/restclient-cpp) library.
The entire project is built and organized using CMake.
